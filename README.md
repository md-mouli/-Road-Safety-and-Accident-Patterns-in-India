Project Description:

The project aims to utilize Qlik's data analytics platform to analyze road safety and accident patterns in India. By leveraging various data sources such as traffic data, accident reports, weather conditions, road infrastructure details, and demographic information, the project seeks to identify trends, hotspots, and factors contributing to road accidents. This analysis can help stakeholders, including government authorities, transportation agencies, and road safety organizations, make data-driven decisions to improve road safety measures, reduce accidents, and save lives.
scenario 1 : Hotspot Identification
Qlik's analytics can pinpoint regions or specific roads in India with a high frequency of accidents. By correlating accident data with factors like traffic volume, road conditions, and time of day, the platform can identify hotspots prone to accidents. This information is crucial for implementing targeted interventions such as enhanced traffic monitoring, improved signage, and speed limit adjustments.
scenario 2 : Trend Analysis Qlik can perform trend analysis on historical accident data to identify patterns and recurring factors leading to accidents. This includes analyzing accident types (e.g., collisions, pedestrian accidents), seasonal variations, and driver behavior (e.g., speeding, distracted driving). Insights gained can guide awareness campaigns, driver training programs, and policy reforms aimed at addressing root causes.
